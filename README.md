### MARKDOWN AUTOMATOR

I hate making markdown documents from scratch because I can never remember what the format looks like and I only have enough room in my brain for a few things. So here is combination of a command line + python tool to help make a template in markdown.

Currently I have a basic blog post that can be set up for a github.io website.

To use this tool enter the following command:

```bash
sh make.sh
```

The command will prompt you to enter the post name, tags, and a link.
